This thesis aims to advance the development of a real-time hardware-based Spiking Neural Network (SNN) for delivering personalized electrical stimulation therapy. Specifically, this work encompasses the characterization of an in vivo Biological Neural Network (BNN) and the fine-tuning of the SNN, named BioemuS, which consists of single-compartment Hodgkin-Huxley neurons with highly biomimetic synapses and noise. Both spontaneous and evoked activity of the BNN are analyzed: the former is used as the target behavior in the SNN tuning phase, while the latter helps to understand how lesions and subsequent traditional stimulation therapies affect the interplay between the premotor and somatosensory areas.
